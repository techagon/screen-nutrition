### Welcome to the **Mindful Clicks, Balanced Picks** Art Jam!

**“Eat your veggies!”**

You all know that veggies are good for you. But how many times do you find yourselves loading up on chips and fries and fast food? In fact, some chip makers now outright challenge you: *Bet you can’t eat just one!*

Professor Dan Ariely, Nobel laureate, the father of behavioral economics, and the author of Predictably Irrational, figured out that under the right conditions, our brains can be hacked. Hacked in a way to get us to willingly do something that is not in our best interests!

Those chip makers figured out how to get you to keep eating their chips, even when they know that they aren’t good for you. When it comes to screens (phones, tablets, laptops, television), the big social media, streaming, and gaming sites that you spend a lot of time on have figured out something similar: how to keep you, the user, hooked onto their sites, doing what is good for them, but not what is good for you!

Here is a video Prof. Ariely himself recorded just for you! Take a look.

# The Contest

For this art jam, come up with a graphic that shows your idea of what it means to have a balanced digital diet.

Be **creative**! Be **memorable**! Be **cool**! Come up with a slogan (or two) if you’d like.

You can learn more about Screen Nutrition, and our ideas here at screennutrition.org. We will feature the best entries online on our website. For the top winning entries, we will print their stickers (either 2in x 2in or 3in x 3in), or other material they have created to raise awareness on the importance of a balanced digital diet.

With that said, here are a couple of examples:

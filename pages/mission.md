# Our Mission

#### Our Mission

To increase awareness about the idea of balanced use of screens

* Help educate children about the idea of balanced screen usage and the dangers of an improper “diet”, so children can make an informed choice about their activities online and not fall prey to the profit-maximizing algorithms of endless content providing platforms(TikTok, Instagram, Youtube, etc.)
* Develop mobile applications that can help children and their parents adopt a balanced use of screen time
* Promote research into algorithms that could be used to achieve a more balanced screen use(safeguards, or alternative balance-aware algorithms):

  + Algorithms that can help children break bad habits
  + Algorithms that content providers could use
  + 3rd party “algorithms”
* Drive legislative change for:

  + The requirement of algorithms that target children(<18 years of age) to be transparent and available for public criticism or examination
